# Multivariate-Linear-Regression

This project was mainly used for my IB Math Analysis and Approaches HL Internal Assessment.

The model was used to explore the three types of Gradient Descent in Multivariate Linear Regression and produce graphs for talks. Hence, the code still produces some graphs and remnant of the IA remain.
